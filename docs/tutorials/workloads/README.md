* Previous Tutorials Series: *none*
* Can run on Cluster: *any* or [multi-node](/tutorials/clusters/multi-node)
* Can run on Namespace: *any*
* Tutorials: [Pods](/tutorials/workloads/pods/), [Deployments](/tutorials/workloads/deployments/), [StatefulSets](/tutorials/workloads/statefulsets/), [DaemonSets](/tutorials/workloads/daemonsets/), [Jobs](/tutorials/workloads/jobs/)

> [Workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) represent the deployment and management of different type of containerized applications on your Kubernetes clusters. Workloads maybe used to run stateless or stateful applications, batch jobs, or daemons.
> 
> You can run this example on any cluster, but for better visualization of the DaemonSets features you can setup a multi-node cluster.
