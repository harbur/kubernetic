# Create a Cluster

In this section you'll setup a Kubernetes cluster locally in your machine.

?> If you already have a cluster running  you can skip this section and go to Cluster Authentication.

We'll cover two ways to run a cluster locally, the first is using [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/), the second is using [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

Choose one way and follow the guide below to prepare the environment. Once the environment is ready you should have a kubernetes cluster up and running and the credentials prepared in order to connect with the cluster.
